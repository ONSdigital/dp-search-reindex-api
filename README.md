### Getting started

* Set up dependencies then run `make debug`

### Dependencies

| GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT    | 20s             | The graceful shutdown timeout in seconds (`time.Duration` format)
| HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL         | 30s             | Time between self-healthchecks (`time.Duration` format)
| HEALTHCHECK_CRITICAL_TIMEOUT | 90s             | Time to wait until an unhealthy dependent propagates its state to make this app unhealthy (`time.Duration` format)
| MAX_REINDEX_JOB_RUNTIME      | 3600s           | The maximum amount of time that a reindex job is allowed to run before another reindex job can be started
| MONGODB_BIND_ADDR            | localhost:27017 | The MongoDB bind address
| MONGODB_COLLECTION           | jobs            | MongoDB collection
| MONGODB_LOCKS_COLLECTION     | jobs_locks      | MongoDB locks collection
| MONGODB_DATABASE             | search          | The MongoDB search database
| DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_LIMIT        | 1000            | The maximum number of reindex jobs to be returned in any list (to prevent performance issues)
| DEFAULT_LIMIT                | 20              | The maximum number of reindex jobs to be returned in a particular list (for a particular request)
| DEFAULT_OFFSET               | 0               | The number of reindex jobs into the full list (i.e. the 0-based index) that a particular response is starting at

### Testing

* Run the component tests with this command `go test -component`
* Run the unit tests with this command `make test`

Postman can be used to test that the endpoints all work as defined in the swagger (replace "ID" with the id value where applicable):
- POST: http://localhost:25700/jobs (should post a default job into mongoDB and return a JSON representation of it)
- GET: http://localhost:25700/jobs/ID NB. Use the id returned by the POST call above e.g. http://localhost:25700/jobs/bc7b87de-abf5-45c5-8e3c-e2a575cab28a (should get a job from mongoDB)
- GET: http://localhost:25700/jobs (should get all the jobs from mongoDB)
- GET: http://localhost:25700/jobs?offset=1&limit=2 (should get no more than 2 jobs, from mongoDB, starting from index 1)
- PUT: http://localhost:25700/jobs/ID/number_of_tasks/10 (should put a value of 10 in the number_of_tasks field for the job with that particular id)
- GET: http://localhost:25700/health (should show the health check details)
