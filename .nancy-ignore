#The nancy command has found a vulnerability, which is an out of date version of GoGo Protobuf. However, this cannot be updated due to the project also having an indirect dependency of something called 
#scram; the latest version of scram has a new path in github, which also needs to be changed (instead of http://github.com/xdg/scram it is now http://github.com/xdg-go/scram I believe). The problem is 
#that if I manually amend this path and version in the go.sum file then it reverts back when I try to commit and push the code (so it won't let me update GoGo Protobuf either). So I need to update the
# dependency that is actually using scram directly. That dependency is actually mongo-driver, which itself is a dependency in dp-component-test, which is a dependency in this project. But on further
# investigation it turns out that mongo-driver itself does not have the latest version of scram. So this build cannot be fixed until a new version of mongo-driver is released and then dp-component-test
# is updated with it. Here's the issue: https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/GODRIVER/issues/GODRIVER-1935?filter=allissues
CVE-2021-3121
